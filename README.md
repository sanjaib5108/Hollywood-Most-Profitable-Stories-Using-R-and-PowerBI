# Project Description
This project is part of my Data Technician Bootcamp by JustIT Ltd. UK. 
I was aksed to create a portfolio based on the skills I have learnt in the Boot Camp. 
As part of this project I have imported the Datset from Tableau Public directly into the Work Directory using R Studio, after importing the dataset, 
Data Cleaning has been done using R Programming TideVerse Library and visuals have been prepared using ggplot2. 
The data has been cleaned and exported and the new data has been imported into Power BI to create beautiful Data Visualizations.
This project includes the Data Load, Transformation and Analysis of the data and then turning Data into beautiful visuals 
which helps to make insights extracted from the Data Visualizations.
